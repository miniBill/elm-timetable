if I mouse over a starting time at the top it highlights the best path to the bottom and also highlights all the times and wait segments

don't sort by first train but do a depth first search by link

if I select a link then all stations not reachable from the destination and not reaching the source should disappear

same for selecting a station: it forces "via" that station

every item has hover and select, hover grays out the rest, select whites out the rest

graph of cities only, for easier viz and selection
